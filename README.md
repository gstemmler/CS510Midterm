# CS510Midterm

The function of this code is to forecast the Wilshire US Reit index using real world data.
The code takes into account weekly, daily, quartley, ad monthly data and converts them to all one format and then numerious models and tests are taking.
Currently the quartely data is missing but I'll find it soon and upload.
Right now that first few steps can be skipped and can just use the merged csv of the data.
