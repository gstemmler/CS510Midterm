# CS510Midterm

The function of this code is to forecast the Wilshire US Reit index using real world data.
The code takes into account weekly, daily, quartley, ad monthly data and converts them to all one format and then numerious models and tests are taking.
In this code we are able to transform the data and run multiple regression models and test to come up with the best model for forecasting the Wilshire Reit Index.

The code should be run in the order that it is scripted and I believe that the it should be able to read the csv files from the github as it works from a clean session.
